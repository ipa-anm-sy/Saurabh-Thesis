Evaluation parameters:
- Weather condition: Sunny, Rainy
- Temperature:
- Humidity:
- Lighting condition: (illumination measurement if the device is available to measure)
- Environment Scenario in detail: sidewalk near a mainroad, park, outside a grocery store main door, city center.

- Human robot interaction scenario: delivering some type of object to the human.
	- Robot description: size, speed, colour
	- Robot task description: object avoidance, delivery of package
	- Robot task reliability: Highly reliable, medium reliable, less reliable, unreliable
	
- Camera description
	- Image size and quality
	- FPS rate of the camera
	
- Computer for FER implementation
	- Confidence for face detection:
	- Face tracking (length of track history):
	- confidence for expression detection:
	- filter conditions for obtained data. 
	
- FER
	- Accuracy of the model
	- period for which same emotion is detected continuosly (fear, disgust is observed then is it observed for 1sec, 2 sec / for 20 frames, 40 frames) 
	- reasoning for the observed emotion.
	
- Questionnare (cross-verification of continuosly observed emotions, its grade)
- Pedestrians's opinion about the acceptance of the robot (reliability level)

==> parameters obtained should be common for robots with wide range of applications so that recommendation for perceived safety can be given.
  	(parameters which I think would be common for many robots)
  	
   -- size of the robot
   -- motion behaviour of robot (steady, predictable/ unsteady, unpredictable) (Can human understand what robot is doing, where it wants to go just by looking at it)
   -- parameters of the robot depending on the task (Human avoidance):- 
   	-side by side passing distance between robot and human
   	-approaching speed of robot towards human (1.5m/s, 1m/s, 0.5m/s) 
   	-distance before which robot changes trajectory (2m, 1m ,0.5m)		
   -reliability of the robot.
   
(Goal after the experiments)
==> Should be able to plot curve for a type of robot.
	Reliability vs emotions
	parameter vs emotions
	
	deduction of acceptance of the robot from emotions
	
	acceptability vs reliability
	acceptability vs parameters.
