Our new version DDAMFN++ is available in the folder https://github.com/simon20010923/DDAMFN/tree/main/DDAMFN%2B%2B, which includes new alignment code refer to https://github.com/biubug6/Pytorch_Retinaface and optimized by SAM ([Sharpness aware minimization for efficiently improving generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01412)).
The trained RAF-DB model is available in DDAMFN++/checkpoints_ver2.0, which is not our best. The affectnet model will soon be available.
